<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section id="intro" class="content">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in building technology that addresses real-world problems. My work lies at the intersection of software development, artificial intelligence, and community-driven innovation. Through hands-on projects and leadership roles, I aim to create solutions that are both technically sound and socially impactful.

<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="content">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, where I actively explore areas such as AI, computer vision, and system design. Beyond academics, I serve as the IEEE Student Branch Chair, leading initiatives that promote technical learning, collaboration, and innovation among students.

I enjoy taking ideas from concept to execution—whether it’s developing applications, organizing large-scale technical events, or working on projects focused on social good. I believe meaningful technology is built when innovation is combined with empathy and purpose.

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Smart Attendance System</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a face recognition–based smart attendance system using OpenCV to automate and streamline attendance tracking. The system detects and recognizes faces in real time, records timestamps accurately, and reduces manual intervention, improving reliability and efficiency in academic environments.
