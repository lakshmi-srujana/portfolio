<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section id="intro" class="content">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="section-subtitle">Who I am and what drives my work</p>

  <p>
    I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in building technology that addresses real-world challenges. My academic journey and projects focus on applying software development and artificial intelligence to create solutions that are practical, inclusive, and impactful.
<br>
<br>
I am particularly drawn to projects that combine technical depth with social relevance, whether through AI-driven applications, data-centric systems, or user-focused platforms. Alongside technical development, I actively engage in leadership and community-building initiatives, believing that innovation grows strongest in collaborative environments.

<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="content">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, where I actively explore areas such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, and system design. I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and application—transforming abstract ideas into functional systems through hands-on development and experimentation.
<br>
<br>
Beyond academics, I serve as the IEEE Student Branch Chair and Founding Lead at my institution. In this role, I have led the establishment of the student branch, coordinated large-scale technical events, and worked closely with peers and mentors to foster a culture of learning, collaboration, and innovation. Leadership, for me, is not just about organizing events, but about enabling others to grow and contribute meaningfully.
<br>
<br>
I am particularly passionate about building technology for social impact. Projects such as AI-driven platforms for community support and accessibility-focused applications reflect my belief that engineering should be empathetic, inclusive, and purpose-driven. As I continue to learn and build, I aim to deepen my technical expertise while creating solutions that positively influence both people and society.

        <h3>Smart Attendance System</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a face recognition–based smart attendance system using OpenCV to automate and streamline attendance tracking. The system detects and recognizes faces in real time, records timestamps accurately, and reduces manual intervention, improving reliability and efficiency in academic environments.

        <h3>SeaTorch: AI-Driven Deep Learning Model for Migration Pattern Prediction With Bilingual Forecasting Support for Sustainable Fisheries</h3>
        <p>
         This paper proposes an accessible digital platform aimed at supporting traditional fishermen by addressing challenges such as unpredictable weather, declining fish stocks, language barriers, and limited access to modern tools. The study presents a predictive, feature-driven approach focused on bilingual support, low-literacy usability, and community-centered design. By integrating planned features such as fish location insights, weather alerts, marine animal awareness, and legal guidance, the paper highlights the potential of human-centered digital solutions to improve safety, livelihoods, and sustainability within coastal fishing communities.
